## faces-book
A simple [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) app for remembering people's faces.
Look at a person's face and try to remember their name.
Then hover the cursor over their face and their name will appear in
a tooltip. Were you right?

Served by [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).
Runs inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.
